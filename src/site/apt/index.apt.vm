Primitive Wrapper for Apache Velocity

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/velocity/VelocityPage.html}<<<VelocityPage>>>}}
  is a convenient builder/wrapper around {{{http://velocity.apache.org/}Apache Velocity}}:

+--
import com.jcabi.velocity.VelocityPage;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String text = new VelocityPage("/com/foo/template.vm")
      .set("name", "John Doe")
      .set("file", file)
      .set("document", doc)
      .toString();
  }
}
+--

  The only argument of the constructor should be an absolute
  path of a classpath resource that contains a Velocity template. Be aware
  that an absolute resource path always starts with a slash.

  The only dependency you need is
  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jcabi/jcabi-velocity/${project.version}/jcabi-velocity-${project.version}.jar}<<<jcabi-velocity-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-velocity</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
